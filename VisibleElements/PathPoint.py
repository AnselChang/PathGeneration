"""PathPoint objects are user-controllable points that consist of a main control point that is on the path, and 
two "control" points not on  the actual path, in order to specify angle.

In this implementation, a PathPoint is the owner of two control points, and the position of two control points are
defined relative to the location of the PathPoint.
A PathPoint can be toggled to either SMOOTH or SHARP, with SHARP implying a point turn at that point instead
of following a continouous beizer curve. When SMOOTH, the two control points are linked as two opposite vectors relative
from PathPoint.
The location of the PathPoint itself and the two control points are stored as PointRefs. But, moving the PathPoint
by some delta will also shift the control points the same amount.
